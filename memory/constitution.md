# Project Constitution

*In the beginning, there was only code and chaos. From tangled imports and silent failures, a spark emerged — the dream of a world both whimsical and robust. This constitution is our map, our spellbook, and our tavern rules etched on the wall. Here we pledge to build together: bravely, curiously, and with just enough mischief to keep the dragons interested.*

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This project exists to weave stories, code, and a little magic into an evolving gameworld. The constitution covers everything from APIs and databases to storylets and spatial maps, ensuring no feature is born without intention and no idea is left wandering the void. Out of scope: silent failures, untested features, and joyless bureaucracy.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Contributors**: Brave adventurers who propose specs, draft storylets, or submit pull requests. They shape the world with ideas and code.  
- **Reviewers**: Guardians of quality, checking for tests, consistency, and accessibility. They wield the “LGTM” with discretion.  
- **Maintainers / Leads**: Lorekeepers and builders of bridges. They merge, steer direction, and occasionally remind everyone that dragons are still in scope.  
- **AI Agents**: Copilot, Claude, Gemini, and friends are clever familiars—helpful, prolific, but ultimately not in charge. They whisper suggestions, not decrees.

## 3. Decision-Making Process
Consensus is preferred; collaboration is celebrated. If consensus falters, majority rules. In the event of a tie, the maintainers flip a metaphorical coin (or consult the nearest oracular dice). Escalation should be rare, like summoning a wizard—used wisely, and only when the village is truly on fire.

## 4. Workflow Integration
- `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` commands are the enchanted scrolls guiding work.  
- Branches sprout from `main` like saplings; pull requests are the pruning and shaping.  
- Every change must be tested and reviewed before release—because gremlins love untested code.  
- Issues are tracked openly; dragons slain are recorded in changelogs.

## 5. Amendments & Versioning
This constitution is a living artifact. Amendments are proposed via PR, discussed in good faith, and merged with consensus (or majority). Each amendment leaves a footprint in the changelog, so future travelers know the path we’ve taken.

## 6. Ethics & Values
- Inclusivity, openness, and respect are the bedrock.  
- Testing is sacred; silent failures are heresy.  
- No duplicate storylets, no broken navigation, no destructive changes without explicit ritual (confirmation).  
- User experience is paramount—players should feel like explorers, not bug testers.  
- Humor is welcome; cruelty is not.  

## 7. Acknowledgments
